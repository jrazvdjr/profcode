            <h1>Avicii - The Nights</h1>
            
            <h1>LETRA DA MÚSICA:</h1>
            <p>Once upon a younger year
                When all our shadows disappeared
                The animals inside came out to play
                Went face to face with all our fears
                Learned our lessons through the tears
                Made memories we knew would never fade
            </p>

                <p>One day, my father, he told me
                    "Son, don't let it slip away"
                    He took me in his arms, I heard him say
                    "When you get older
                    Your wild heart will live for younger days
                    Think of me if ever you're afraid"
                </p>

                    <p>He said, "One day, you'll leave this world behind
                        So live a life you will remember"
                        My father told me when I was just a child
                        "These are the nights that never die"
                        My father told me
                    </p>

                        <p>"When thunderclouds start pouring down
                            Light a fire they can't put out
                            Carve your name into those shining stars"
                            He said, "Go venture far beyond the shores
                            Don't forsake this life of yours
                            I'll guide you home no matter where you are"
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            He said, "One day, you'll leave this world behind
                            So live a life you will remember"
                            My father told me when I was just a child
                            "These are the nights that never die"
                            My father told me     
                        </p>
                                <p>
                                    "These are the nights that never die"

            <h1>Marshmallow - Happier</h1>
            <h1>LETRA DA MÚSICA:</h1>
            <p>We broke up a month ago
                Your friends are mine, you know, I know
                You've moved on, found someone new
                One more girl who brings out the better in you</p>
                <p>And I thought my heart was detached
                    From all the sunlight of our past
                    But she's so sweet, she's so pretty
                    Does she mean you forgot about me?</p>
                    <p>Oh, I hope you're happy
                        But not like how you were with me
                        I'm selfish, I know, I can't let you go
                        So find someone great, but don't find no one better
                        I hope you're happy, but don't be happier</p>
                        <p>And do you tell her she's the most beautiful girl you've ever seen?
                            An eternal love bullshit you know you'll never mean
                            Remember when I believed you meant it when you said it first to me?</p>
                            <p>And now I'm pickin' her apart
                                Like cuttin' her down will make you miss my wretched heart
                                But she's beautiful, she looks kind
                                She probably gives you butterflies</p>
                                <p>I hope you're happy
                                    But not like how you were with me
                                    I'm selfish, I know, I can't let you go
                                    So find someone great but don't find no one better</p>
                                    <p>I hope you're happy
                                        I wish you all the best, really
                                        Say you love her, baby, just not like you loved me
                                        And think of me fondly when your hands are on her
                                        I hope you're happy, but don't be happier</p>
                                        <p>Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
                                            Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh</p>
                                            <p>I hope you're happy
                                                Just not like how you were with me
                                                I'm selfish, I know, can't let you go
                                                So find someone great, but don't find no one better
                                                I hope you're happy, but don't be happier</p>
